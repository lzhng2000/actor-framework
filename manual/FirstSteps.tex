\section{First Steps}

%\subsection{Why Actors?}

%\subsection{Some Terminology}

To compile \lib, you will need CMake and a C++11 compiler. To get and compile the sources, open a terminal (on Linux or Mac OS X) and type:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework
cd actor-framework
./configure
make
make install [as root, optional]
\end{verbatim}

It is recommended to run the unit tests as well:

\begin{verbatim}
make test
\end{verbatim}

Please submit a bug report that includes (a) your compiler version, (b) your OS, and (c) the content of the file \texttt{build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log} if an error occurs.

\subsection{Features Overview}

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Lightweight, fast and efficient actor implementations
  \item Network transparent messaging
  \item Error handling based on Erlang's failure model
  \item Pattern matching for messages as internal DSL to ease development
  \item Thread-mapped actors for soft migration of existing applications
  \item Publish/subscribe group communication
\end{itemize*}


\subsection{Supported Compilers}

\begin{itemize*}
  \item GCC $\ge$ 4.8
  \item Clang $\ge$ 3.2
  \item Visual Studio $\ge$ 2015 (update 2)
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Supported Operating Systems}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Linux
\item Mac OS X
\item Windows\footnote{partial support; advanced match cases will not compile and there is currently no support for using CAF as DLL}
\end{itemize*}
